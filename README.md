This repo records my personal interests: a combination of data science and a game called League of legends. All Random All Math (ARAM) is a series of projects, in which data science techniques are applied to discuss some interesting topics in League of Legends. This is the second post of this project. I intended to start from something simple, then gradually, I will use more advanced techniques to explore even further.
